00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome to Mr Pinas' home,
Marciano Pinas. Mrs Derks called us.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,000
A sweet but over-concerned neighbour.
You know the type. What a coincidence.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,440
Good of you to come so quickly.
I’m Jeanine. Mr Pinas is a lovely man.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,960
He used to ask me over for dinner.
He was a great cook.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,840
But since his wife died suddenly last year
he has deteriorated.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,200
The dear old man is so confused, lately.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,440
I do his shopping,
but still he keeps losing weight.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,760
Mr Pinas, it's me. You have a visitor.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,200
Hello, Mr Pinas. I've brought somebody
to have a chat with you.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,480
Who are you?

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,520
Do you know what's wrong
with Mr Pinas?

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,800
You have three minutes to work it out.
Good luck.

13
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,400
What are you doing?

14
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm afraid you didn't succeed.

15
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,360
There is often more to a situation
than you initially think.

16
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,640
You must get an overview
and take the right decision.

17
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,400
Come on, you can do it.

18
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,880
No, there is no guessing
in geriatric care.

19
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,520
What are you doing here?

20
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,360
I don't need anything.

21
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,120
It's already in the evening.

22
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,080
Did that other lady also come with you?

23
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,040
General Practitioner J.P. Terpstra
020 - 7604600

24
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,080
Thursday.
Morning, afternoon, evening.

25
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,080
Look at this. All the food has gone off
and he hasn't eaten any of it.

26
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,080
What do I know about Mr Pinas?

27
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,640
Last year, his wife died suddenly.
She wasn't from Surinam, by the way.

28
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,320
His family is in Surinam. He has trouble
walking, that's why I do the shopping.

29
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Nowadays, all his food is going off.
And he's forgetting so many things.

30
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,640
But that's due
to the early-stage dementia.

31
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,120
I collect his medication
because he refuses home care.

32
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,680
What else?
He's seeing things that aren't here.

33
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,280
That's all I can tell you.

34
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,240
So, what do you think?
Is Mr Pinas eating and drinking enough?

35
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,080
Is he taking his medication properly?

36
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,080
Not eating and drinking, not knowing
whether it's day or night.

37
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,080
What do you make of it?

38
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,040
Have you worked it out?
Please tell us.

39
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,440
You could do that but be careful.
Don't make any snap decisions.

40
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,160
Take your time with Mr Pinas.

41
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,040
Yes, indeed. First, you get an overview
and then you act.

42
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,320
What's wrong with Mr Pinas?

43
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,760
The fridge is full
but Mr Pinas clearly isn't.

44
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,960
His dementia plays a role
but there is more to this.

45
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Very good. His fridge is full
but Mr Pinas clearly isn't.

46
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,560
He has symptoms of a delirium.

47
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,920
You know enough to consult the GP
about how to stabilize his situation.

48
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,080
Final question:
What is your follow-up plan?

49
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,040
Mr Pinas needs more than a clock. But
a hospital admission isn't needed either.

50
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,080
Think ahead.

51
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,520
Well done. With a plan
for home care and support...

52
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,520
and the neighbour's assistance
you can really help Mr Pinas.

53
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,520
It's just a first step towards
getting Mr Pinas back on track again.

54
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,640
