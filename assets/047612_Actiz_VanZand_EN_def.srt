1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,680
Hello, good of you to come. What a cool
bike, that will get you from A to B.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,680
This is Mr and Mrs van Zand's house.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,400
They've lived here for 40 years
and they don't want to leave.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,280
Mr van Zand has COPD and rheumatism.
He hardly leaves the house.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,000
But Mrs van Zand
takes good care of him.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,840
Are you here already?
Well, you might as well come in.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,040
Coby van Zand.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,680
Cees van Zand, hello.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,600
And, how do you assess this situation?
You have three minutes to work it out.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,320
Good luck.

11
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,880
Are you okay?
-Of course.

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,720
Are you sure?
-Of course.

13
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm afraid you didn't succeed.

14
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,760
In geriatric care,
there is often more to a situation.

15
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,040
You must get an overview
and take the right decision.

16
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,440
Try again.
Good luck, you can do it.

17
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,880
There's no guessing in geriatric care.

18
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Could you make us a cup of coffee?
Normally, my wife does it.

19
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,720
I'm not capable of much anymore, so
she does everything around the house.

20
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,760
Far too much, really. But
she's stubborn, so what can you do.

21
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,440
No, I'm fine.

22
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,040
We enjoy doing everything ourselves
while we still can.

23
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,360
And we're managing fine.
We don't need anybody's help. Do we?

24
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,960
10:40 hairdresser.

25
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,080
Interesting, normally you shake hands
with your right hand.

26
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,160
There are broken bits everywhere.
Do you think Mrs van Zand can manage?

27
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,120
It won't be cleared up soon.
It's time to take action.

28
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,520
Do you know? Let's continue.
What's the first thing you do now?

29
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,520
No, I'm afraid not.
Mrs van Zand has severe osteoporosis.

30
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,040
Maybe you should take that into account.

31
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,600
And yes, that is the correct answer.

32
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,760
This lady may have damaged her arm
due to osteoporosis.

33
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,920
The GP should take a look at it.

34
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,760
But there is more to this.
What is the real problem?

35
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,720
No, I'm afraid not.

36
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,120
It seems obvious but you must get
an overview of the entire situation.

37
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,760
Try again.

38
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,920
Yes, good observation. Mrs van Zand
is an overburdened carer. Carry on.

39
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,960
Last question:
What is your long-term plan?

40
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,200
That's a very drastic measure
and unnecessary.

41
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,480
Mr and Mrs van Zand
can stay living at home.

42
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,800
But you have to draw up a plan together.

43
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,320
Good plan.

44
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,560
Talk to Mr and Mrs and
draw up a plan for home care.

45
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,800
So they can keep living at home
while Mrs van Zand gets support.

46
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,240
Help her together with your colleagues.
Have you done all the cases yet?

47
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,120
You'll see that a registered nurse has
a very important job. Think about it.
