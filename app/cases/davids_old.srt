1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,400
Hello, good to see you.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,000
We're on the rehabilitation ward
where Mr Davids is staying.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,800
He had hip surgery last week.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,000
Normally, Mr Davids is a cheerful man.
A bit like me, really.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,800
But you'll see that he's not himself,
today. Here we are.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,720
Somebody else again?

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,800
Okay, what's wrong with Mr Davids?
You have three minutes to work it out.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,320
Good luck.

9
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,440
I'm afraid you didn't succeed.

10
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,840
In geriatric care,
there is often more to a situation.

11
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,000
You must get an overview
and take the right decision.

12
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Try again.
Come on, you can do it.

13
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,200
No, guessing isn't allowed.

14
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,280
I don't get it. Normally, I can do
a crossword puzzle in no time at all.

15
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
But now...

16
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,640
Lovely, but it gives you sticky fingers.

17
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,160
Mr Davids has kept
his diary properly. Hasn't he?

18
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
To measure is to know, so they say.

19
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,320
Get well soon.

20
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,600
Dear dad, get well soon.
We'll come to visit you.

21
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,640
Did you work it out? Great. So tell me:
What's the underlying problem?

22
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,560
That's not the right answer. Take a look
at the clues. I'm sure you'll work it out.

23
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,840
Yes, Mr Davids has diabetes
and he probably had some cake.

24
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,000
His sticky fingers biased
blood glucose measurements.

25
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,560
That's why he injected too much insulin.
What do you do now?

26
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,800
No, Mr Davids is hypoglycaemic,
his blood sugar must go up quickly.

27
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,560
Painkillers and insulin
will only make matters worse.

28
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,520
What's the very first thing you do now?

29
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,760
Yes, very good.

30
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,480
With a glass of lemonade and a sandwich
he'll soon feel much better.

31
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Last question: How can we prevent
this from happening in future?

32
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,240
No, the elderly aren't children.

33
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,280
Telling Mr Davids off and taking away
his sweets, is that a good idea?

34
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Well done, obviously it's just
the first step to help Mr Davids.

35
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,520
See?
There is often more to it than you think.

36
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,560
You have the overview, you decide.
